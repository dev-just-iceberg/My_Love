	I can't really find a way to say how much am happy that you finaly told all of this
   Am really proud of you that you took time to think about all of this and to tell me at the end
   And yes, I won't leave you no matter what.
   You know for a long time now and you reall understand how I think and how my brain works
   I can't really understand why God give me such a bless "aka Czea Karaza",
   Am so thankful/gratful for everything
   I don't want you to be my angel "you can't" but for me you are my heart which is much much more then that
   Czea will be the heart of Mahdi always "ALWAYS"
   Am not really cold, well sometimes am silent and just take everything slowly
   You can really see that I don't hide anything from you even though I know it'll hurt you
   "NO, she's my heart and she have to know exactly how I feel and think" are words always going through my mind
   The fact that we get here is insine for me, I'd never thought I would be in
   Yasterday I meet a girl in a random server in a random platform in a random vc,
   First thought "dumn she's cute, I wish if she can be my girl friend"
   I replied to myself "don't be stupid, this will never happen. stop fucking dreaming"
   Today... am writing a really beautiful message to the same girl after going though a "LOT" with her
   And hearing her saying "I love you" and me reflacting on these thoughts that I had back then
   "oh, dumn again she's here for me" a words that I always tell myself
   "there's someone out there for you", "I have someone who's proud of me", "don't worry she's there" ... etc
   A lot and a lot of thoughts rush into my mind
   My mind is complex and am not ashamed to say that. Though, you are taking a big part of it that's for sure
   The amount of trust and belief I have on you is unmeasured
   Even though I work my mind through what I should say and do
   I know that if things goes wrong you won't throw me like everyone else did
   I always wanted a girl/woman that can hold me that won't just leave me, **that'll take care of me**
   "I want to be with you" that's all I can say because no matter how much I say it won't be enough
   I want you to be strong in the real way and beautiful in your own way
   No, you are not a bad person. And no, you are not toxic
   You still learning and if you have a debt about this, read all or this again and again
   "It's ok to not be ok" someone I love told me that
   I know things sometimes get really hard but I say "hey it's ok"
   Because I love you and I want you to believe in yourself and stay calm
   So that you can find a way out
   Distance sucks but as long as am with you am really thankful
   I like distance for a reason too
   cause it made us closer even though we are not
   Till I see you face to face, I'll always find a way
   Waiting is hard but it's what makes things worth it
   I am and will take care of your heart with all what I have
   I never give up remmember, promises can be broke but I don't give up which means that I'll never break them
   All of our promises still holds a deep place in my heart and will always
   And don't worry about being a bad person before, we all was there
   And we all realized and learned and **changed**
   I want you to one thing
   Have an objective in life something that you really want to do
   I want to change the world and I want you to be with me though all that
   The same thing goes for you
   And I want you to believe in yourself
   For real Czea believe in yourself that's something I can't give you
   Only you can do it, I helped you by telling you this
   Help me by doing it, ok
   I will thank you just once because I can't count everything I should be thankful for

   Darling thank you, I love you

   and there's no Coincidence, no luck, no paths
   Only Destiny
