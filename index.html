   I can't really find a way to say how much am happy that you finaly told all of this <br />
   Am really proud of you that you took time to think about all of this and to tell me at the end<br />

   And yes, I won't leave you no matter what.<br />

   You know for a long time now and you reall understand how I think and how my brain works<br /><br />

   I can't really understand why God give me such a bless "aka Czea Karaza",<br />

   Am so thankful/gratful for everything<br />

   I don't want you to be my angel "you can't" but for me you are my heart which is much much more then that<br /><br />

   Czea will be the heart of Mahdi always "ALWAYS"<br /><br />

   Am not really cold, well sometimes am silent and just take everything slowly<br />

   You can really see that I don't hide anything from you even though I know it'll hurt you<br />

   "NO, she's my heart and she have to know exactly how I feel and think" are words always going through my mind<br />

   The fact that we get here is insine for me, I'd never thought I would be in<br /><br />

   Yasterday I meet a girl in a random server in a random platform in a random vc,<br /><br />

   First thought "dumn she's cute, I wish if she can be my girl friend"<br />

   I replied to myself "don't be stupid, this will never happen. stop fucking dreaming"<br />

   Today... am writing a really beautiful message to the same girl after going though a "LOT" with her<br /><br />

   And hearing her saying "I love you" and me reflacting on these thoughts that I had back then<br /><br />

   "oh, dumn again she's here for me" a words that I always tell myself<br /><br />

   "there's someone out there for you", "I have someone who's proud of me", "don't worry she's there" ... etc<br />

   A lot and a lot of thoughts rush into my mind<br /><br />

   My mind is complex and am not ashamed to say that. Though, you are taking a big part of it that's for sure<br /><br />

   The amount of trust and belief I have on you is unmeasured<br />

   Even though I work my mind through what I should say and do<br />

   I know that if things goes wrong you won't throw me like everyone else did<br /><br />

   I always wanted a girl/woman that can hold me that won't just leave me, <b>that'll take care of me</b><br />

   "I want to be with you" that's all I can say because no matter how much I say it won't be enough<br />

   I want you to be strong in the real way and beautiful in your own way<br />

   No, you are not a bad person. And no, you are not toxic<br />

   You still learning and if you have a debt about this, read all or this again and again<br /><br />

   "It's ok to not be ok" someone I love told me that<br /><br />

   I know things sometimes get really hard but I say "hey it's ok"<br />

   Because I love you and I want you to believe in yourself and stay calm<br />

   So that you can find a way out<br /><br />

   Distance sucks but as long as am with you am really thankful<br />

   I like distance for a reason too<br />

   cause it made us closer even though we are not<br /><br />

   Till I see you face to face, I'll always find a way<br />

   Waiting is hard but it's what makes things worth it<br />

   I am and will take care of your heart with all what I have<br /><br />

   I never give up remmember, promises can be broke but I don't give up which means that I'll never break them<br /><br />

   All of our promises still holds a deep place in my heart and will always<br />

   And don't worry about being a bad person before, we all was there<br />

   And we all realized and learned and <b>changed</b><br />

   I want you to one thing<br /><br />

   Have an objective in life something that you really want to do<br />

   I want to change the world and I want you to be with me though all that<br /><br />

   The same thing goes for you<br /><br />

   And I want you to believe in yourself<br /><br />

   For real Czea believe in yourself that's something I can't give you<br />

   Only you can do it, I helped you by telling you this<br />

   Help me by doing it, ok<br /><br />

   I will thank you just once because I can't count everything I should be thankful for<br />

<br /><br /><br /><br />

   Darling thank you, I love you<br />

<br /><br /><br />

   and there's no Coincidence, no luck, no paths<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

   Only Destiny<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><a href="https://youtu.be/BsZ3iNvunio">let's watch this together :)</a>
